# Find It for Cities: Skylines II
Quickly browse and search through all of the assets inside of the game.

Use **Ctrl+P** to enable the Picker tool, or click on the picker icon in your toolbar.

Use **Ctrl+R** to select a random asset from the list, or click on the random button in the Find It panel.
