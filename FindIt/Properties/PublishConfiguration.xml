# Find It [Beta] for Cities: Skylines II
Quickly browse and search through all of the assets inside of the game.
Use **Ctrl+F** to quickly open the Find It panel, or click on the magnifier icon in your toolbar.
Use **Ctrl+P** to enable the Picker tool, or click on the picker icon in your toolbar.

Huge thanks to **YenYang** for their help on the UI.

Special thanks to **Algernon** for their contribution and allowing me to take on this project

And thank you to **Chameleon** for providing the Icons.

And thank you to **Baka-gourd** (NullPinter) for their help with focus.

## Features
* Uses similar categories lookup methods as the base game. As well as the vanilla UI components.
* Quick and intelligent search methods.
* Find It panel stays open while placing assets, no jumping between different tabs.
* Tool options like Tree Controller and Line Tool are fully supported and can be used while the panel is open.
* Thumbnails for all assets, no more guessing what something is.
* Favorite your most used assets.
* Integrated Picker

## Planned Features
* Mutli-tab support, to have multiple instances open at the same time
* Custom tagging, add your own tags to assets. Will also come with cross compatibility with Skyve.
* Advanced filtering options
* Customizable panel size.
* Asset information when hovering over an item.

## Notes
Find It should automatically support any mods that add or alter the vanilla assets.
For example: Extra Landscaping Tool and Extra Networks and Areas

This is currently in public Beta, but it should be stable to use.

If you're having any issues, please report them on my discord as it's easier to help you that way.
