# Find It for Cities: Skylines II
Quickly browse and search through all of the assets inside of the game.
Use **Ctrl+F** to quickly open the Find It panel, or click on the magnifier icon in your toolbar.
Use **Ctrl+P** to enable the Picker tool, or click on the picker icon in your toolbar.

Huge thanks to **YenYang** for their help on the UI.
