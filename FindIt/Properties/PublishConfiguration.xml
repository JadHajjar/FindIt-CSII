# Find It for Cities: Skylines II
Quickly browse and search through all of the assets inside of the game.

Use **Ctrl+F** to quickly open the Find It panel, or click on the magnifier icon in your toolbar.

Use **Ctrl+P** to enable the Picker tool, or click on the picker icon in your toolbar.

Use **Ctrl+R** to select a random asset from the list, or click on the random button in the Find It panel.


Huge thanks to **YenYang** for their help on the UI.

Special thanks to **Algernon** for their contribution and allowing me to take on this project

Thank you to **Chameleon** for providing the Icons.

And thank you to **Baka-gourd** (NullPinter) for their help with focus.
